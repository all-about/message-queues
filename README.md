# All about Message Queues

I've encountered different kinds of message queues over my career and also have worked on systems which used messaging queues but I've never completely dug deeper into learning more about them. 

I've found myself reading random articles about Kafka, rabbitMQ or sometimes one of those comparison articles between these or the latest Apache Puslar. But I still couldn't get the confidence to say that I know enough about them. I continued to have questions as follows :

- Why to use them? What do they offer?
- When to use them?
- Which one to use?
- How to use them?

I've decided that I've got do this better. What I was missing was a structured way of demystifying this subject. 

I've realised the questions above actually provide a decent structure for my exploration. These questions actually translate into the following sub-topics :

- Use Cases / When to use
- Features / What they offer
- Comparison / Which one
- Implementation / How to use

So I'll be following this structure.


## Common Use Cases - When

## Features - What

I'm going to come up with all the possible features the message queues are offering out there and also explain which use case each feature is trying to solve.


## Comparison - Which


## Implementation - How
